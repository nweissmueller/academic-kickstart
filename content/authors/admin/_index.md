My work focuses on advanced analytics in support of immuno-oncology drug development. Specifically, I develop tools that help decision makers achieve clarity of action by quantifying value trade-offs. These tools leverage statistical learning techniques together with classical decision analysis. I believe that analytics will be a key differentiating factor for speeding efficacious medicines to patients.
