abstract: One factor limiting the expansion of nanomedicines has
been the high cost of the materials and processes required for their
production. We present a continuous, scalable, low cost nano-
encapsulation process, Flash Nanoprecipitation (FNP) that enables the
production of nanocarriers (NCs) with a narrow size distribution using
zein corn proteins. Zein is a low cost, GRAS protein (having the FDA
status of “Generally Regarded as Safe”) currently used in food
applications, which acts as an effective encapsulant for hydrophobic
compounds using FNP. The four-stream FNP configuration allows the
encapsulation of very hydrophobic compounds in a way that is not
possible with previous precipitation processes. We present the
encapsulation of several model active compounds with as high as 45 wt
% drug loading with respect to zein concentration into ∼100 nm
nanocarriers. Three examples are presented: (1) the pro-drug antioxidant,
vitamin E-acetate, (2) an anticholera quorum-sensing modulator CAI-1 ((S)-3-hydroxytridecan-4-one; CAI-1 that reduces Vibrio cholerae virulence by modulating cellular communication), and (3) hydrophobic fluorescent dyes with a range of hydrophobicities. The specific interaction between zein and the milk protein, sodium caseinate, provides stabilization of the NCs in PBS, LB medium, and in pH 2 solutions. The stability and size changes in the three media provide information on the mechanism of assembly of the zein/active/casein NC.
