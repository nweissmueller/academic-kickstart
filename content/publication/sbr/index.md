abstract: After an overview of FDA’s draft guidances to industry on adaptive designs and enrichment strategies for clinical trials, we describe recent advances in adaptive confirmatory trial designs and statistical methods for their analysis. We then focus on biomarker-guided personalized therapies in the era of precision medicine, and precision-guided drug development and master protocols, and conclude with innovations in statistical science for precision medicine and regulatory submission.
